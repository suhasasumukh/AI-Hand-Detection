## Real-Time Hand Tracking with OpenCV and MediaPipe

### Overview

This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to enable real time hand tracking using a webcam. The application captures video input, processes it to identify hand landmarks, and displays the tracked landmarks on the screen.

### Tech Stack

- OpenCV [for vision]
- MediaPipe [for building perception pipelines]

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10.1
- Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suhasasumukh/AI-Hand-Detection.git
```

```bash
cd AI-Hand-Detection
```

### Run the application

```bash
python hand_tracking.py
```

### Features
- Real time hand tracking with multiple hand landmark recognition
- Display of hand connections for better visualization
- Easy to install and minimal setup required
